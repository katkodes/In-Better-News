Final Web Proposal Project 

 

Site: In-Better-News.Com 

Topic: The topic of the website will be to share positive and inspiring news, information, and experiences. The site will be for a client however, the client is giving me sole creative control over the layout and functionality of the website. Incorporating their input will include considering their end-goal for the site and the use the client intends for it. A domain name and hosting will eventually be purchased for this website. The site will be tested by a random sample of people for functionality, ease of use, level of interest in the content, etc. Adjustments will be made to the scope of the content, functionality, aesthetics, etc., based on feedback. 

Goal: The goal of the site will be to motivate and inspire viewers, to encourage them to visit often, and to promote original content/sell merchandise.  

Audience: The intended audience is made up of young adults and adults who may be a bit more sensitive to or frustrated with the disparity of bad news and negative images that are shared through media. The target audience prefers to surround themselves with uplifting thoughts, images, smells, and sounds. They tend to be inspired more by nature, genuine/thoughtful/provocative interactions between humans, or humans and nature. The target audience is eclectic, believes in (as well as strive for) world peace, and enjoys technology, socializing, and spending money on ethically-sourced, fair-trade, etc. type items. 

Content: The site will mostly be composed of borrowed content in the form of news stories, shared experiences, images, quotes, and videos that will be free from copyright. Original content will include images and memes. Over time, the site will expand to include original news stories of local examples of inspirational stories/facts and an e-commerce store. The content will need to be updated either weekly or bi-weekly with articles, videos, and/or memes that cover as many subtopics as possible to hold interest and remain relevant. Ideally, the site would need to be updated either daily or weekly but, without a dedicated content manager, this is not probable. 

Organization: The site will have our pages: Home, About, Contact, and an E-Store. The site will be organized around one, central static home page that users can interact with to show/hide content of interest. Users will interact with a side navigation menu that will have different categories from which users may select from categories of content related to either: Art/Music, Business/Politics, S.T.E.M., and Local/National/International news. When selected, the panel slides out, giving users the option to choose to filter the content by type: video, written (articles), or images (memes). After selecting the form of content desired, users can choose from the available thumbnail links what they want to view.  

 

[Text Wrapping Break] 

 

JQuery & AJAX: When hovered over, thumbnail links display a caption of the content; video links play a short preview clip. When selected, content fills the view window on the same (home) page as opposed to being loaded on a separate page or in a new window. Content that is not original will have a link that will allow users to leave the website to view the original source of the content. AJAX can be used to incorporate original content (such as videos, text, or images) from the server into the website without having to disrupt the user experience. The site will content will be navigated through the home page without having to reload. The navigation tabs on the home page will be used to show/hide content based on what the user clicks. 

Maintenance: To ensure ease of maintenance, the website documents will be labeled and nested inside of folders to keep content on the server separated by file type (i.e. images, CSS, JavaScript, etc.). Also, the lines of code will have detailed comments to ensure that whoever is responsible for managing content can find where everything is currently and where new items should be placed. For example, the content window where videos/articles/memes will be displayed when selected, will be labeled in the code so that the content manager will know what ID or class reference to make to pull content to that area of the page.
