# In-Better-News
Web development and programming project for Advanced JavaScript - Summer 2018 UMUC

For this assignment, I created a single page application (SPA) that displays only good news. One of the most challenging parts of this project was making the ajax calls. I kept encountering errors when making asynchronous calls.
